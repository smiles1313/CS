This was a CS 32 project where we generated a tour that gave directions to a specified location while providing commentary.
The route taken on the tour is programmed to be an optimal one.
Main Topics: Route Optimization & Time Complexity Optimization | Hashmaps | Classes.

You can use [this](https://mobisoftinfotech.com/tools/plot-multiple-points-on-map/) online geoplotter to produce a visual map of the route.
